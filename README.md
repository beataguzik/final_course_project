## General Information
- a project to create a Snake Game
- I undertook the project because i like this game and it reminds me of the times when the first games appeared

- my game rules:
The player starts the snake game by running the code in the terminal (-> python snake.py).
The snake is controlled with the arrows (up, down, right, left). By pressing the arrow longer - the snake accelerates, releasing - it slows down.
When the snake eats the food it lengthens and the points are added up and displayed on the board.
If the snake eats itself or reaches the edge of the board - it loses.
The game continues until the snake is long enough to fit on the board.
when the game is over, you are asked whether you continue playing or quit.
